Wine Classification with Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project involves applying machine learning techniques to the Wine dataset to classify wines into their respective classes based on their chemical properties. The dataset contains 178 samples of wine, each belonging to one of three classes. The project explores data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation, and interpretation of results using various machine learning models.

Instructions for Running the Project

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Setting Up the Environment
Clone the Repository or Download the Files:

Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
Open Google Colaboratory:

Open Google Colaboratory in your web browser.

Upload the ipynb file:
Upload the ipynb file (Wine_Classification.ipynb) to your Google Collab session.

2. Uploading the Dataset
Upload the Wine.csv File:

The dataset used in this project is stored in the submission folder and is called Wine.csv. To upload this file to your Colaboratory session:
Click on the "Files" tab on the left-hand side of the Colaboratory interface.
Click on the "Upload" button and select the Wine.csv file from your local machine.

3. Running the Code
Run the Notebook:

Once the dataset is uploaded, run each cell in the notebook sequentially. The notebook includes code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
Analyze the Results:

Review the output, including metrics, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance analyses.

Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

These libraries are available in Google Colaboratory by default. If you are running the notebook on a different platform, ensure these dependencies are installed. You can install them using the following commands:

pip install pandas==2.0.3 numpy==1.24.3 scikit-learn==1.3.0 matplotlib==3.7.1 seaborn==0.12.2
